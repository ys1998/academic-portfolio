<div class="home"> 

<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is Siddhartha Gulhare, and I am a PhD student in transportation engineering under Dr. Siva Srinivasan at University of Florida. My PhD thesis is about extracting behavioral information such as value of travel time from Artificial Neural Networks.<br><br>

In this website, I maintain a list of my publications, research projects and implementations under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="">Github profile.</a><br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I blog (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="/blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>
